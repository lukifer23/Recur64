# HP X1 experiment ledger

Fast-falsification ledger for X15 / Chimera. Labels: MEASURED, INFERRED,
POST-HOC, NOT RUN. Each entry: QUESTION, PRE-REGISTERED RULE, CONFIG, WALL TIME,
MEASURED, INTERPRETATION, DECISION, NEXT ACTION.

Starting SHA for this phase: `c60103bd95b4f535b381f2f1cd985ea9e2998984`
(branch `experiment/hp-r15-h3-integration`, clean tree, remote in sync).

## Time policy
Fast falsification. Cells of minutes, no experiment over 60 minutes, about 2
hours cumulative GPU time, then stop and report.

## E0 - P0 source fixes (no GPU)
- QUESTION: is the checkout sound enough to run science on?
- MEASURED: all seven P0 findings confirmed and fixed (D60, D61). Workspace
  tests (arena tests skipped) and clippy pass; fmt clean.
- DECISION: proceed to CUDA qualification.
