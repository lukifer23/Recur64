# Workstation V2.5 — experiment ledger

Each entry: QUESTION / HYPOTHESIS / PRE-REGISTERED RULE / CONFIG / DATA DIGEST / WALL /
PEAK VRAM / MEASURED / INFERRED / DECISION / NEXT ACTION. Rules are written BEFORE the
run. Entries are appended; they are never rewritten after results are seen.

## Pre-registered gates (fixed before any training)
- P0: all 20 architecture-correctness items must pass. No science if P0 fails.
- P0.5: if CandidateFacts costs >20% of end-to-end self-play evaluation wall, optimize
  without changing semantics.
- P0.6: training layout must be finite with peak VRAM <= 12 GB; failed cells stay visible.
- P1: CF, seed 1, LR in {3e-5, 7.5e-5, 1.5e-4, 3e-4}, ~75–100 updates, selection on TUNE
  policy CE / correct-move mass / stability (never train loss alone).
- P2 (L, C0, CF × 2 seeds, 400 updates, policy-only):
  - Q1 FACTS PATH GO iff CF M1 top-1 >= 0.95 AND CF > C0 paired 95% CI entirely > 0 AND both seeds positive.
  - Q3: CF M2 top-1 >= 0.75 and M3 top-1 >= 0.55 (both seeds at/near floors with pooled CI clear of chance).
  - One extension only: 400 → 800 updates if train/tune still improve with no overfit gap and healthy gradients. Then CONFIRM once more; if still short, STOP (no self-play).
  - Thresholds may be amended only BEFORE CONFIRM is seen.
- P3 (frozen conversion suite, argmax from ply 0, no noise, solver off): proof-trained CF
  beats corrected F10 by >= 10 wins/128 TARGET starts (searched), paired bootstrap 95% CI > 0,
  no catastrophic HEAVY regression; M3 CONFIRM playout conversion >= 80%.
- P3.5: one M4/M5 extension only if M1–M3 strong, M3 playout strong, transfer weak.
- P4: only if P3 passes; 2-cycle smoke at most; curriculum conversion < 70% for two
  consecutive cycles is a hard stop.
